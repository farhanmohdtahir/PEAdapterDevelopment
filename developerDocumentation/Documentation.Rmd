## Paired-End Adapter Finder v16  
  
The Paired-End Adapter Finder identify two consensus adapter sequences from Reads 1 and Reads 2 of paired-
end sequencing by using the Needleman-Wunsh algorithm to align the two reads and determining which region of
the sequence is actually an adapter. The user has to input two fastq format files, corresponding to Read 1 and Read 2, the input file can be 4-line FASTQ file or multi-line FASTQ file, and the result will be the consensus adapter sequences for both the Adapters in Read 1 and Read 2 respectively of the paired-end sequencing.
